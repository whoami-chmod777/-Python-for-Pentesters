• For loops can have a "else" statement as well 
• write a simple program to illustrate this functionality


-- Names --

#!/usr/bin/python

names = ['vivek', 'miro', 'peachy', 'neo', "panda"]

for name in names:
    print(name)
    if name == "andy":
        break
else:
    print("All names were succesfully printed!")



-- Fruits --

#!/usr/share/python

# list of fruits
my_list = ["papaya","banana","pineapple","mango","grapes"]

# iterating through the fruit list
for i in my_list:
   if i == "mango":
       print("mango found!")
       break
else:
   print("mango not found!")
